# Quickstart

### Setting up the environment variables

Navigate into your projects directory and get your environment variables ready:

```shell
cd nextjs-starter-medusa/
mv .env.template .env
```

It is the public key that allows the frontend to communicate in an authorized manner with the Medusa Store API.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

What is it for?

- It authorizes requests from the store (frontend) to the Medusa backend.
- It limits access to the Sales Channels associated with that key.
- It allows retrieving products, regions, cart contents, prices, and other public store resources.
- It is safe to expose on the frontend (that's why it starts with NEXT_PUBLIC_).

Without this key, the backend will respond with:

```
A valid publishable key is required to proceed with the request
```

Where is the NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY generated?

```
Settings → Developer → Publishable API Keys
```

### Install dependencies

Use Yarn to install all dependencies.

```shell
yarn
```

### Start developing

You are now ready to start up your project.

```shell
yarn dev
```

### Open the code and start customizing

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000
